# tidycensus-wrapper
This code has not previously existed under my profile because it has been housed in a repo under the Sorenson Impact organizational account. Though that repo is private the code contained herein is fine to be shared publicly. The primary function, called `get_acs_combo` enhances Kyle Walker's `tidycensus` package by using Davis Vaughan's `furrr` package to work through computations in parallel. This greatly speeds up `tidycensus` in situations where you need to query data for many different geographies or over the course of multiple years. It also automatically joins the queried data with their variable descriptors and assigns an appropriate geography level name for the geography column (eg. 'county', 'state', etc.) in addition to a few others features meant to enhance ease of use.
